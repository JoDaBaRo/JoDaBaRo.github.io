Migrating your Ruby on Rails 7 app to use Docker Compose on Heroku involves several steps. You can definitely keep the same Heroku app and the same database, avoiding the need to create a new app and migrate data. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Prepare your Application**:
   - Ensure your application is Docker-ready. This means configuring your app to run in a Docker environment. You'll need a `Dockerfile` that sets up your Rails environment, installs dependencies, precompiles assets, etc.
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for local development. However, Heroku uses its own container orchestration, so `docker-compose` is primarily for your local setup. For Heroku, you'll focus on the Docker container itself.

2. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root. Here’s an example structure:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM ruby:3.1
   RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y nodejs postgresql-client
   WORKDIR /myapp
   COPY Gemfile /myapp/Gemfile
   COPY Gemfile.lock /myapp/Gemfile.lock
   RUN bundle install
   COPY . /myapp

   # Add a script to be executed every time the container starts.
   COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/bin/
   RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/entrypoint.sh
   ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint.sh"]
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Start the main process.
   CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
   ```

   - This is just an example. Adapt it according to your project's specifics.

3. **Heroku Setup**:
   - If you haven’t already, log in to Heroku and create a new app if necessary.
   - Set up the Heroku Container Registry by running `heroku container:login`.
   - You can use the same Heroku PostgreSQL add-on with your containerized app. Heroku will provide the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which Rails can use to connect to the database.

4. **Deploying with Heroku**:
   - Remove the Heroku Ruby buildpack if it's been set (as you'll be using container-based deployment).
   - Push your Docker container to Heroku with `heroku container:push web -a your_app_name_here`.
   - Release the pushed container with `heroku container:release web -a your_app_name_here`.
   - Ensure all your environment variables, such as `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, are set in Heroku's settings.

5. **Database Migrations**:
   After deploying, don't forget to run your database migrations with `heroku run rake db:migrate -a your_app_name_here`.

6. **Local Development**:
   For local development, you can use Docker Compose. Your `docker-compose.yml` might look like this:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     web:
       build: .
       command: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'
       volumes:
         - .:/myapp
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - db
     db:
       image: postgres
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: your_user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_password
   ```

   This allows you to run your app with `docker-compose up`.

7. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update your Docker images with the latest security patches.
   - Monitor Heroku's changelog and Docker-related updates.

Remember, this is a high-level overview. You might encounter specific challenges based on your app's details and dependencies. Testing thoroughly in a local Docker environment before deploying to Heroku is crucial. By maintaining the same Heroku app, you keep your existing resources, including your Heroku PostgreSQL instance, minimizing the migration's complexity.
